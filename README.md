# SimpleMIDIDemo
This is a dead simple example of connecting to and receiving data from MIDI devices in a Swift OS X app. I wrote this in a few minutes to show how simple it is to use `MIKMIDIConnectionManager` to connect to MIDI devices and receive data from them. It is mean to be a very quick intro to that API rather than example of a full on MIDI app.
